        <p>Budding software engineer, musician, artist, internet peruser.</p>
        <p>This is an excuse for me to learn how to build a website, and is really just an example of my ability to use CSS and make div elements look Not Terrible Looking.</p>
        <p>If you're looking to know more about me as a professional, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/azengyu/">LinkedIn</a> is the way to go!</p>

        <h3>Where did I come from?</h3>
        <p>I graduated with a B.A. and M.A. in Linguistics from the University of California, Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>While I was there, I also completed a specialization in computing (a.k.a I took a handful of pre-major CS courses in the School of Engineer)</p>
        <p>My linguistics research interests include intonation, syntax (a strange mixture of X-Bar and Minimalism, which I believe is a UCLA staple). My computing interests include automation workflows and the general field of machine learning + natural language processing.</p>
        <h3>What am I doing and what have I done?</h3>
        <p>Currently, I am a Jr. FeedDev Engineer at Feedonomics, writing in PHP.</p>
        <p>While I was in college, I did linguistics research for the University of Maryland Center for Advanced Study of Language, as well as copyediting work for the U.S. Embassy in Beijing + Hitachi Data Systems.</p>
        <p>Two publications. Four talks.</p>
        <p>Outside of work, I also participate in many music-related ventures (See below in 'Music' section)</p>
        <p>Full CV available.</p>

        <p>Why, this site of course.</p>
        <p>I also attempted to participate in Advent of Code 2017. It's a series of daily programming puzzles (like a litle advent calendar, except more dorky :3). I only managed to squirm my way through the first half-ish (ok, like 11 days worth out of 25), but I'm still pretty proud of how I did it (especially since I didn't know how to "code" all of them and managed to do some of them by logic-ing it out)</p>
        <p>Take a peek at my <a href="https://github.com/karillith/Advent-of-Code-2017">Advent of Code 2017</a> repo (and marvel in my floundering).</p>
        <p>More things hopefully to come.</p>

        <h3>Materia Collective</h3>
        <p>Sometimes I create music and it's available for purchase.</p>
        <p>All the albums that I've been a part of are listed on my <a href="https://www.materiacollective.com/artist/ann_zeng">artist page on the Materia Collective website</a>.</p>
        <p>I am particularly proud of my first and only solo track from <a href="https://www.materiacollective.com/music/successor_final_fantasy_viii_remixed">Successor: Final Fantasy VIII Remixed</a> where I demonstrate my a cappella chops (click the album art to play the song on Spotify).</p>

        <h3>Stormlight</h3>
        <p>My friends are in a band called Stormlight. Sometimes, I sing back up or play keys for them.</p>
        <p>Their EP release party is on 12/5! It will be my first performance with them.</p>
        <h3>Other</h3>
        <p>Sometimes I'll mess around with my microphone and put the results up so people can hear it. Here's a playlist of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country)#Music">Georgian folk music</a> from <a href="https://soundcloud.com/karillith">my SoundCloud</a>.</p>
        <p><iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/210779236&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
        <p>There was also that one time a group of folks and I got honorable mention for putting together a little cover of "Night in the Brume" for the <a href="http://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/ded5277471c476b85b85d4c6dd88653ec6e604f7">Heavensward Music Contest</a>.</p>
